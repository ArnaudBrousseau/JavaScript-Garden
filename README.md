JavaScript Garden
=================

**JavaScript Garden** is a growing collection of documentation about the most 
quirky parts of the JavaScript programming language. It gives advice to 
avoid common mistakes, subtle bugs, as well as performance issues and bad 
practices that non-expert JavaScript programmers may encounter on their 
endeavours into the depths of the language.

JavaScript Garden does **not** aim to teach you JavaScript. Former knowledge
of the language is strongly recommended in order to understand the topics covered
in this guide. In order to learn the basics of the language, please head over to 
the excellent [guide][1] on the Mozilla Developer Network.

### How To Contribute?

The JavaScript Garden is a statically built website. If you want to contribute,
just clone this repo, and modify one of the markdown files in `doc/`. To build 
the site, you'll need NodeJS and the dependencies listed in `package.json`. To
install them all at once, `cd` inside your local copy of the repo and run
`npm install`. Once that's done, run `node build.js` to generate the site.
